## [v1.0.0](http://github.com/ndustrialio/contxt-sdk-js/tree/v1.0.0) (2019-05-28)

**Changed**

- Updated build process to only transpile source files instead of also concatenating into a single module

  - This will allow us to substitute out modules when the browser and Node version needs to differ (like the Message Bus module at the moment)
  - Additionally, it will allow end users to import a specific file from the package to use or extend it (i.e. when creating a custom module, a user might want to use our object utilities to transform object key cases or extend off an already built module to add or monkey-patch functionality)
  - Provides separate CommonJS and ES Module file trees (in `/lib` and `/esm`, respectively) to be used directly by Node, Webpack, or the user's preferred bundling application
  - The directory for the ES modules build has changed. If a project was directly importing the ES module instead of the root package, this will need to be updated (i.e. `import ContxtSdk from 'contxt-sdk/es'` to `import ContxtSdk from 'contxt-sdk/esm'`)
  - **NOTE:** The Babel configuration has been moved from the `.babelrc` file to the `package.json` so that the configuration can be shared with the Gulp build process and testing via Mocha. If upgrading to Babel 7, this should be moved to a `babel.config.js` file (this functionality was added in 7).

- Added Browser versions of Message Bus related modules that indicate connecting to the Message Bus is not supported in browser environments at the moment.
- Changed back to using UUIDv4s as IDs for Message Bus subscriptions and publications.
- Refactored Auth0WebAuth to better handle access tokens provided by contxt-auth. Each API/audience now gets its own token instead of getting one big token that contained every possible API/audience combination.

  - If using `Auth#getCurrentApiToken` (especially if not passing in the audience name/API name), pay extra attention to this update. The output has the same format, but the information that should be expected in the token is slightly different (there will be less information).

- Split Coordinator module into multiple submodules

```js
//Applications Module
coordinator.createFavoriteApplication()	-> coordinator.applications.addFavorite()
coordinator.getAllApplications() -> coordinator.applications.getAll()
coordinator.getFavoriteApplications() -> coordinator.applications.getFavorites()
coordinator.getFeaturedApplications() -> coordinator.applications.getFeatured()
coordinator.deleteFavoriteApplication()	-> coordinator.applications.removeFavorite()

//Organizations Module
coordinator.getOrganizationById() -> coordinator.organizations.get()
coordinator.getAllOrganizations() -> coordinator.organizations.getAll()

//Permissions Module
coordinator.getUserPermissionsMap()	-> coordinator.permissions.getByUserId()

coordinator.activateNewUser() -> coordinator.users.activate()
coordinator.getUser() -> coordinator.users.get()
coordinator.getUsersByOrganization() -> coordinator.users.getByOrganizationId()
coordinator.inviteNewUserToOrganization() -> coordinator.users.invite()
coordinator.removeUserFromOrganization() -> coordinator.users.remove()
```
